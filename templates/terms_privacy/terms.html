                    </h2>
                    <h4>• ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h4>
                    <p>This Agreement, together with the other Terms of Service, sets forth the entire agreement and
                        understanding between you and Techjobs.one relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and
                        cancels and suspends any prior or contemporaneous discussions, agreements, representations,
                        warranties, and other communications between you and us, written or verbal, to the extent they
                        relate in any way to the subject matter hereof and thereof. The section headings in the Terms of
                        Service are interred for ease of reference, solely, and as such have no binding effect. Even
                        though Techjobs.one drafted the Terms of Service, you submit that you have had sufficient time
                        to review and decide whether to agree to the Terms of Service. If an ambiguity or question of
                        intent or interpretation of The Terms of Service arises, no presumption nor burden of proof will
                        arise favoring or disfavoring you or Techjobs.one because of the drafting of any provision of
                        the Terms of Service.</p>
                    <h4>• MODIFICATIONS</h4>
                    <p>
                        No modification or amendment to the Terms of Service will be binding upon Techjobs.one unless in
                        contained in a written instrument signed by an authorized representative of Techjobs.one or
                        posted on the Site by Techjobs.one. Our failure to act or act promptly to a breach by you or
                        other Users does not waive our right to act with respect to successive or similar breaches. We
                        do not guarantee we will take action against all breaches of this User Agreement.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        • ASSIGNABILITY
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        A User may not assign the Terms of Service, or any rights or obligations within, without
                        Techjobs.one’s prior written consent in the form of a written instrument signed by an authorized
                        representative of Techjobs.one. Techjobs.one may freely assign this Agreement and the other
                        Terms of Service without a User’s consent. Any attempted assignment or transfer of this
                        subsection, consequently, will be null and void. The Terms of Service, subject to the
                        aforementioned restrictions, are binding upon and will condition to the benefit of the heirs,
                        successors and permitted assigns of the parties.
                    </p>
                    <h4>• SEVERABILITY</h4>
                    <p>If and to the extent and provision of this Agreement or the other Terms of Service is held
                        illegal, invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part under applicable law, such provision or
                        such segment thereof will be ineffective as to the jurisdiction in which it is deemed illegal,
                        invalid, or unenforceable to the extent of its illegality, invalidity, or unenforceability and
                        will be therefore considered modified as far as conformity with applicable law necessitates so
                        as to give the maximum effect to the intent of the parties. The illegality, invalidity, or
                        unenforceability of such provision in that jurisdiction will not in any way affect the
                        illegality, validity, or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction or of any
                        other provision in any jurisdiction.</p>
                    <h4>• force majeure</h4>
                    <p>The parties to this Agreement will not be responsible for the failure to perform or any delay in
                        performance of any obligation herein for a reasonable period due to labour disturbances,
                        vicissitudes of nature, fires, floods, earthquakes, volcanoes, telecommunications or internet
                        failures, strikes, wars, riots, rebellions, blockades, acts of government, governmental
                        requirements and regulations or restrictions imposed by law or any other similar conditions
                        beyond the reasonable control of such party</p>
                    <h4>• PREVAILING LANGUAGE AND LOCAATION</h4>
                    <p>The English language version of the Terms of Service will be prevail over any other translated
                        versions in the case of any inconsistencies. The Site is controlled from our facilities in
                        Georgia</p>
                    <h4>• CONSENT TO USE ELECTRONIC RECORDS</h4>
                    <p>In connection with the Site Terms of Use, you may be entitled to receive certain records from
                        Techjobs.one or our Affiliates, such as contracts, notices, and communications, in writing. To
                        facilitate your use of the Site and the Site Services, you hereby permit us to provide these
                        records to you electronically instead of in paper form.
