                        Who is responsible for the data collection on this website?

                        Your data will be collected on the one hand, that you tell us. For example, this may be data

                        above all technical data (eg Internet browser, operating system or time of the page request).
                        The
                        collection of this data is automatic as soon as you enter our website.
                        What do we use your data for?
                        Part of the data is collected to ensure a flawless provision of the website. Other data can be

                        to analyze your user behavior.
                        What rights do you have regarding your data?
                        At any time you have the right to obtain free information about the origin, recipient and

                        When you visit our website, your surfing behavior can be statistically evaluated. This happens
                        mainly with cookies and with so-called analysis programs. The analysis of your surfing behavior

                        We point out that the data transmission in the Internet (eg in the communication by E-Mail) can
                        exhibit security gaps. A complete protection of the data from access by third parties is not
                        possible.

                        Revocation of your consent to data processing
                        Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke an
                        existing consent at any time. An informal message by e-mail to us is sufficient. The legality of
                        the
                        data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
                        Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority
                        In the case of violations of data protection law, the person concerned has the right of appeal
                        to

                        contract, in itself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you require
                        the
                        direct transfer of data to another person in charge, this will only be done to the extent

                        Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and stored by your browser.
                        Most of the cookies we use are so-called “session cookies”. They are automatically deleted after
                        your visit. Other cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them. These cookies
                        allow us to recognize your browser the next time you visit.
                        You can set your browser so that you are informed about the setting of cookies and allow cookies
                        only in individual cases, the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or generally exclude and
                        enable the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. Disabling cookies may limit
                        the functionality of this website.
                        Cookies that are required to carry out the electronic communication process or to provide
                        certain functions that you wish to use (eg shopping cart function) are processed on the basis of

                        of cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. If other
                        cookies (eg cookies for the analysis of your surfing behavior) are stored, they will be treated
                        separately in this privacy policy.

                        The processing of the data entered into the contact form is therefore exclusively based on your
                        consent (Art. 6 (1) lit. DSGVO). You can revoke this consent at any time. An informal message by
                        e-mail to us is sufficient. The legality of the data processing operations carried out until the
                        revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
                        The data entered by you in the contact form remain with us until you ask us for deletion, revoke
                        your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage is omitted (eg after completion
                        of your request). Mandatory statutory provisions – especially retention periods – remain
                        unaffected.

                    <p>Our comment function stores the IP addresses of the users who write comments. Since we do not
                        check comments on our site before activation, we need this information in order to be able to

                        course of subscribing to comments will be deleted in this case; however, if you have submitted
                        this data to us for other purposes and elsewhere (eg, newsletter order), they will remain with
                        us.</p>
                    <h3>Storage duration of the comments</h3>
                    <p>The comments and the associated data (eg IP address) are stored and remain on our website until
                        the commented content has been completely deleted or the comments must be deleted for legal
                        reasons (eg offensive comments).</p>
                    <h3>Legal basis</h3>
                    <p>The comments are stored on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 (1) a DSGVO). You can revoke your
                        consent at any time. An informal message by e-mail to us is sufficient. The legality of the
                        already completed data processing operations remains unaffected by the revocation</p>

                        information about the page you viewed when you clicked +1. Your + 1’s may appear alongside your
                        profile name and photo in Google services, such as search results or in your Google profile, or
                        elsewhere on websites and ads on the web.

                    <p>
                        This website uses Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program of Google Inc., 1600

                        As part of Google AdWords, we use the so-called conversion tracking. When you click on an ad
                        served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small text files that the
                        Internet browser stores on the user’s computer. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days
                        and are not used for the personal identification of the users. If the user visits certain pages
                        of this website and the cookie has not expired yet, Google and we can recognize that the user
                        clicked on the ad and was redirected to this page.
                        Each Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. The cookies can not be tracked through
                        the websites of advertisers. The information gathered using the conversion cookie is used to
                        generate conversion statistics for AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking.
                        Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a
                        conversion tracking tag page. However, they do not receive information that personally
                        identifies users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can opt-out of this by
                        easily disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie through its Internet browser under User
                        Preferences. You will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.
                        The storage of “conversion cookies” is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. The website
                        operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior in order to optimize both its

                        of the website visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis begins automatically as
                        soon as the website visitor enters the website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various

                        made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to Google.<br>
                        The reCAPTCHA analyzes are completely in the background. Site visitors are not advised that an

                        understand the effectiveness of the Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes,
                        in which we see whether users were redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad
                        (so-called “conversion”).
